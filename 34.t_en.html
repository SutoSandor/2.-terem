  <h1>World War I memorials in Gödöllő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
      After the mobilization following the outbreak of the war, more than 500 people marched in from Gödöllő as soldiers. Most of them were immediately directed to the front after a few weeks of training. The total number of those who marched in from Gödöllő is close to 900 people. During the war, more than 200 of them died a heroic death.<br><br>
      Already at the beginning of the war, in the autumn of 1914, the people's relief commission of Gödöllő on Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch's proposition made a decision to erect a memorial in the cemetery commemorating the Gödöllő soldiers who were killed in the fights. In addition to the proposition, the committee accepted Körösfői's statue plan and wanted to erect the statue at their own expense next to the patriots' memorial. However, the memorial statue was not completed, instead a memorial cross was erected, which was inaugurated on 1 November 1914, at 5 pm.<br><br>
      During the 1920s and 30s several commemorative tablets were unveiled on the walls of buildings owned by institutions, associations and churches. On 8 January 1922 the Jewish community inaugurated the marble tablet of their brethren who died during the war. The tablet listed 9 names. In 1923, on the wall of the industrial corporate headquarters they placed a memorial tablet with the list of the deceased members. The tablet has the name of 15 masters and 49 apprentices. On 7 November 1925 the memorial tablet of the heroes fallen in the war was unveiled at the forestry headquarters. On 3 September 1939, the new building of the fire station and the memorial tablet on its wall with the names of six heroes were inaugurated at the same time .<br><br>
      In 1929, a new heroes' memorial was unveiled in Gödöllő, in the park of the Premonstratensian Convent and Gymnasium. It commemorated the Premonstratensian students, old students and teachers of Kosice, Oradea and Rožňava who died in the First World War. The inauguration took place on 29 May, 1929. The rectangular-shaped quarry stone block -- on whose sides there were marble tablets with the names of the heroes -- was built according to the plans of Róbert Kertész K. and Gyula Sváb.  On the top cover of the artwork in a bronze chalice there was soil from Košice, Rožňava and Oradea to remind people of the dead. The memorial was demolished in the 1950s.<br><br>
      In April 1927 the representative body of Gödöllő decided to commemorate the fallen soldiers with a new sculpture. They commissioned Lőrincz Siklódy sculptor to create the monument. The statue was finally inaugurated on September 7, 1930 at 11 am. Special trains arrived for the initiation not only from Gödöllő and Gödöllő district, but also from the neighboring districts and Budapest too. The statue was unveiled by the governor Miklós Horthy at 11 am. With this sculpture design Lőrincz Siklódy won the capital's great prize in the national spring exhibition. The hardships of the sculpture began more than 20 years after the installation, in the 1950s. Originally the following lines were written on the plinth: "We do not forget. We cannot forget ... ". This was removed in the 1950s.On the front side of the plinth there was a crowned coat of arms, of which the crown was hewn off in the 50s. In 1970 with the building of the co-operative store the square's structure was transformed. Then the memorial - as an inappropriate object -, was declared not desirable and banished to an abandoned part of the old Protestant cemetery where it stood among the graves for 30 years. It could be returned to its original location only in 1990.<br><br>
      The last monument commemorated rather the consequences of war and less the heroic dead. The country flag was inaugurated on October 6, 1935 , next to the castle, in the park area in front of the castle church. The building consists of a stone mound and a carved stone with the national coat of arms in the center. On the top of the monument, above a crown of thorns, there is the tricolor flag flown half-mast.<br><br>
