  <h1>The history of the cemeteries in Gödöllő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
     The first cemetery in Gödöllő was the cemetery around the church. In the site of the castle there was a Catholic chapel already in 1492, which was destroyed along with the settlement. Later, the chapel was restored, but this time it was already used by the Protestants. In the middle of the 18th century the village had only a Protestant cemetery. The cemetery was around today's palace chapel. In the mid-18th century Gödöllő and almost all the settlements of the surrounding area became the property of Count Antal Grassalkovich. The church and the cemetery was in the way during the building of the castle, so the count had it torn down,  and the cemetery liquidated. As a compensation he provided the Protestants land, money and building materials to build a new church. Instead of the cemetery, he gave a part of the land where the Protestant cemetery is now, on today's Dózsa György road. They started to build the chapel in 1746, in the third period of the construction of the castle. During the construction works they did not ruin the entire cemetery, only those graves that fell in the way. A significant part of the bodies lying in the undisturbed graves are still there where they were buried before. <br><br>
    Instead of the previous cemetery  Antal Grassalkovich gave the Protestants an area taken from a pasture near the town, for burial purposes. Prior to the building of the chapel  - at the liquidation of the cemetery - the new cemetery had to work since the bodies had to be reburied somewhere. So the new cemetery definitely had to work in 1746. Since the mid-18th century, as a result of Grassalkovich's settling down people, a growing number of German, Slovak and Hungarian Catholics arrived to the village. Thus, it became necessary to establish a Catholic cemetery as well. It opened in the 1750s next to the existing Protestant cemetery. In the mid 18th century, the last inhabited street in the town was today's Kossuth Lajos street. Thus, there was enough distance between the cemetery and the village at that time. By the beginning of the 20th century both the Catholic and the Protestant cemeteries were almost full. In 1903, it became more and more common in the Catholic cemetery that during grave-digging older graves were disturbed. Thus, the expansion of the cemetery became necessary. In addition, the town began to grow around the graveyard. Today's Kőrösfői street reached the cemetery fence in the mid-19th century. The houses on today's Dózsa György road stretched one kilometer beyond the cemetery in the early 20th century. So as a result of the development of the town the cemetery became urban area. However they had to wait for the expansion of the cemetery a half-century. First the Catholics submitted a claim in 1940 to the Ministry of Agriculture to obtain a small land from the crown estate, next to the old cemetery. They intended to ease overcrowding in the graveyard with this area, and on the other hand, wanted to build their mortuary there. Not long after the Protestants also submitted their petition to the Ministry of Agriculture on the matter. Two years after the submission, in August 1942, the Roman Catholic parish priest received a formal notice from the Royal Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture that the Ministry gave two cadastral acres from the crown estate area belonging to the Farm of Haraszt to the church, for the purpose of enlarging the cemetery. Not long after the Protestant Church received a similar notice. The blessing of the new cemetery part finally took place in November 1942.<br><br>
    The cemetery in Máriabesnyő was established in the first half of the 19th century. The Capuchin brothers used the crypt of the expanded church as a burial place, so they did not need a separate cemetery. Antal Gassalkovich I. built seven houses close to the convent, where he deployed superannuated manorial servants. Their most important task was the maintenance and cleaning of the church and its surroundings and to take care of the pilgrims, but they had to be buried in the cemetery in Gödöllő. The data referring to the first burial originates from 1849, when the Capuchin Fathers buried here a wandering carpenter, who died of a disease. Until the early 20th century, with few exceptions, probably the residents of Hétház were buried here. Based on the 1882 cadastral map the oldest part of the cemetery was located in the north-west of the present-day cemetery,  far from the road, on the hillside. However, as Besnyő became a holiday area and the number of the population started to increase, the cemetery soon proved to be too small. It reached its current size after several enlargements, in 1927.<br><br>
    The old Jewish cemetery, that is still visible today, was opened in the middle of the 19th century, far away from the town, in Alvég, on the area between today's Isaszegi Road, Fürdő Street and Légszesz Street. The Jewish community, that was established in 1852, bought the area. The community considered it a high priority to provide a cemetery of adequate size for its members. The right size was important, because it was forbidden to bury on the old graves or even disturb them. The Jewish cemetery was cut off from one of the village pastures, whose north-western corner was unsuitable for farming because it was sandy. Following the opening they built a ceremonial cleansing hall near the cemetery's main entrance, which was called Cidduk Hádia. In Gödöllő it could be in the north-west corner of the cemetery , on the road side, by every indication near to the then main entrance. According to the registers the first funeral could take place in 1857. During the opening, the area was only for agricultural activities, the urban residential buildings were hundreds of meters away from the cemetery. However, by the end of the 19th century, the situation changed. Because after the Compromise Gödöllő became a royal holiday resort, more and more people wanted to go on a holiday to Gödöllő, mainly Budapest citizens. For the holidaymakers it was important to have easy access to the train. The track passed near the cemetery. By the end of the 19th century the cemetery was embraced by houses, even a swimming pool was opened close to it. Already in 1896 a municipal decision ordered the closing of the Jewish cemetery, that was already in an inappropriate place, surrounded by houses, but this only took place in 1937 when a new cemetery was constructed next to the farm, by the Csapás road, on a 600-acre land.<br><br>
    The Premonstratensian Order marked out the order's  new cemetery in 1927, close to the monastery in the Fácános. The monks requested permission for the blessing of the administratively approved cemetery from the bishop in April 1928. They buried their dead here from 1928 until 1950. A total of 16 deceased order members and a high school student were buried here. In 1944, 16 Hungarian soldiers were added to those who were buried here. After the closing of the cemetery  the Premonstratensian monks opened a new parcel in the neighborhood of the Dózsa György road cemetery gate. They got the new cemetery part from the Catholic parish in 1950.<br><br>
