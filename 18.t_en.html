  <h1>Famous holiday homes in Gödöllő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
   Adél Diósy Ödönné Brüll (1872-1934)<br><br>
After nine years of relationship Endre Ady broke up with Léda, Adél Diósy Ödönné Brüll in 1912. The Diósy couple came to Gödöllő long after the death of Ady (1919).<br><br>
Ödön Diósy bought the imposing house under 14 Erzsébet királyné road (today Ady Endre promenade) in 1923. The " grandiose villa that would fit to be a castle" was surrounded by a wonderful garden. At the back of the garden stood the caretaker's apartment with a room and a kitchen. Adél Brüll bought the house from her husband in 1924. Although they had a flat in Pest as well, until Léda's death this was their permanent residence.<br><br>
She did not want to move from Berlin to Gödöllő, however, the financial opportunities made this tranquil haven possible. She did not maintain contact with the town's residents. Only dr. István Berente went to her, the doctor, who treated her depression.<br><br>
After the death of Léda the villa was sold, the remaining parlor set is the property of the museum. The house is still standing today, divided into several flats.<br><br>

Zoltán Ambrus (1861-1932), writer<br><br>

His father, József Ambrus was hospitalized in the castle after the battle of Isaszeg (1849). On his doctor's advice, because of the father's recurrent injury, they rented an apartment in Gödöllő from the summer of 1880. His mother was happy to come here, because among her ancestors there were several estate officials (János Foltin, Mihály Kovacsóczy).  Though the father died, they regularly spent the summers here. His mother eventually bought a house in 1897 in the Tégla street (now Lovarda street), and from spring to autumn she lived there with his granddaughter, Gizella, whom she raised because of her mother's death.<br><br>
For Zoltán Ambrus staying in Gödöllő meant relaxation. He was walking in the parks and in the woods with his friends, and his wife, and after her death on his own. In the evenings he worked by a kerosene lamp, sitting on the porch.<br><br>
Gödöllő itself and the imprint of the Gödöllő stays appear in his short story, entitled Alkonyat (Twilight) and in his novel, Midas király (King Midas). He wrote here his articles for the Pesti Napló (The Pest Diary) too.<br><br>
The house is still standing, it is privately owned.<br><br>

Géza Ottlik (1912-1990), writer<br><br>
Géza Ottlik was bound to Gödöllő for thirty years. He mentions the town as Monostor in his novel entitled Buda. Between 1924 and 1946 they used the house bought by his mother under 11 Király street (now Köztársaság road) as a holiday home. The five-room house had a large garden reaching to the forest. Ottlik spent his holidays there happily.<br><br>
After the Second World War, in 1946, he moved here with his wife, Gyöngyi Debreczeni. Because of the land inherited from his mother they were put on kulak list, they lost their main source of income. Gödöllő became a refuge avoiding deportation, they lived here until 1954.<br><br>
During this period, translation provided him with some income. He translated mainly English and American literature, including the novels of Dickens: Bleak House, The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit and David Copperfield. His first version of his novel School at the Frontier, entitled Továbbélők (Survivors) was born in Gödöllő as well.<br><br>
The house is still standing, it is privately owned.<br><br>

Lujza Blaha (1850-1926), actress<br><br>
Lujza Blaha and her third husband, Baron Ödön Splényi bought a holiday home in Gödöllő in 1881, the year of their marriage. Today it is a part of the property under 132-138 Blaháné road, which was theirs, although it was originally larger, reaching up to the Lázár Vilmos road. One of the rooms in the house was furnished based on her favorite play, The Red Pouch. In 1893, when Lujza Blaha sold the Gödöllő house, the furniture was bought by László Kafka sheriff, who had a holiday home next door. The furniture was presented at the district exhibition in 1926.<br><br>
The former house of Lujza Blaha was destroyed in 1944 in a bombing. The land was bought by Antal Kampis (1913-1982) art historian in 1965. He built here a small, two-room, fully equipped cottage. Antal Kampis donated the house and the land, combined with his art collection to Gödöllő town in 1978. Today, the training park of the Imre Montágh School and the Blaha Summer Daycare Camp operate on the property.<br><br>
