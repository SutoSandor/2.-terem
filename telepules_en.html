  <h1>Settlement structure changes in Gödöllő from the baroque period to the mid-20th century</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">


Antal Grassalkovich I became the owner of Gödöllő in 1748. Thanks to him the settlement grew significantly both in its territory and its population. The settlement was divided into Alvég, Felvég and Hídvég (Lower End, Upper End, Bridge End) Alvég, used to be located on the site of today's Endre Ady promenade, there were houses on both sides of the road leading from Isaszeg towards Vác. Felvég used to be in the northern part of the settlement, at the place of today's Bajcsy-Zsilinszki street, the end of which was closed by some serf houses in the place of today's Szilhát Street. Hídvég used to lie between Alvég and Felvég, along the Rákos stream, at the place of today's Sándor Petőfi street.<br><br>
Antal Grassalkovich did not significantly change the settlement structure that had already been built, but of course he modified it according to his own needs in order to provide the appropriate place for the palace and the buildings needed for the estate. In the northern part of Alvég he demolished the medieval church used by protestants near the current main road no. 3 and its surrounding churchyard, and started building the palace in this place. In the centre of the settlement he had the noble mansion built by Ferenc Hamvay demolished and replaced by a one-storey inn. The count opened new streets connected to the existing settlement parts. He had the trees of the heath forest reaching up to the palace cut down in today's Liberty Square, where he built the fair ground (market square), which was closed on the north side by houses, but he provided a place for the new protestant church here. He opened the present-day Lajos Kossuth street in the area cleared of the forest behind the fair ground and closed the settlement with today's Körösfői street, where only farm buildings were built. New houses were built along today's main road no. 3 too. In the newly built streets German style houses were provided for his settlers, and of course, part of the estate's office buildings and the officials’ apartments were also built in the new residential area. <br><br>
The first major transformation of the settlement structure created in the 18th century took place in the 1860s, when a significant part of the manor and serf houses were demolished in the eastern side of Alvég. By the middle of the 19th century a slight development in the street network had taken place. New streets were opened connected to existing ones. A significant increase in the settlement's inner area was due to the royal era, when Gödöllő developed into a holiday resort after 1867. The growth in the residential area could not sufficiently follow the increase in the population. As a result, dwelling houses also started to appear in the streets previously used for agricultural purposes, next to or in place of the buildings used for economic production. In the inner part of the settlement, the farmyards at the end of long plots were separated with part of the plot and new residential buildings were built on the newly created plots. The congestion of the settlement is indicated by the fact that dwelling houses appeared on the plots of the agricultural area nearest to the city limits. Along with the development of the inner area, the outer area also started developing rapidly as of the second half of the 19th century, for the reasons already mentioned. Beginning from the 19th century the pasture areas of public property near the settlement were parcelled out. In the majority of cases entrepreneurs bought the land areas in one, and then parcelled out and sold the plots themselves. New residential areas with newly built residential houses and villas started to appear. By the end of the 19th century, the former fair ground - then Franz Joseph square - and many of the houses of Váci út had been changed according to the era, the fashion trend and the functional change. Thanks to the royal holiday resort and lively civilian life, Gödöllő had become a sparkling settlement full of life once again by the late 19th and early 20th century. Stores, restaurants and shops appeared in the city centre and from then on they defined the character of the main square.<br><br>
