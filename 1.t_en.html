  <h1>The operation of Gödöllő estate</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
      The operation of the estate during the Grassalkoviches (from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century)<br><br>
      Antal Grassalkovich I. (1694-1771) by the middle of the 18th century purchased all of Gödöllő from the previous owners. After long centuries the settlement finally had only one owner. The landlord made the village the center of his Pest and Heves County lands. He started to develop Gödöllő into a noble residence worthy of a center, and the acquired lands to a well-functioning large estate.<br><br>
      During the years of his lordship he erected more than 80 buildings in the Gödöllő estate, in which offices, clerks homes, agricultural services (mill, butcher, pub, inn, sheepcote, etc) worked.  As a patron, in addition to the castle, he built churches and a school, as well as public art works and bridges. That was when our city's image was formed, which was destroyed in the 1970s, with the socialist construction works.<br><br>
      Parallel to the growth of the estates, the system to ensure their operation had to be built too. The large estate worked as an economic unit, the most important was to ensure profitability. For this managing officers, manorial officers and servants were needed. The head of the officers was the praefectus or the steward. The bailiff dealt with the grain crops, the accountant dealt with the finances. Among the managing officers there was a prosecutor, an engineer and a doctor. The units of the  management were the ispánságs (counties), with an ispán (count) in control. Because of their duties the landlords had an impact on every aspect of life of the serfs living on the estate, they ensured administration of justice, controlled public safety, took care of orphans and old servants.<br><br>
      The estate founder count for the sake of economic growth gained market town status for Gödöllő  (1763), his serfs were taxed according to favorable conditions. His son and grandson, Antal II. and III. did not care about the development, they considered their estates only as a source of income. The Grassalkovich family  branch became extinct in the male line with Antal III. (1841), the heirs, the Viczay family took over the Gödöllő estate in 1848. During the revolution, the managing officers were interested in the abolition of serfdom,  which was the basis of the operation of the estate, as well as their own fate, which depended on the new owner.<br><br>
      The estate of Gödöllő soon fell into the hands of the Baron Sina family (1851-1867), then briefly to a Belgian bank, finally it became state property in 1867.

      The crown estate (1867)<br><br>
      Unlike in previous centuries the estate duties and needs were determined by the frameworks of the civilian era. The landlords did not have legal, law enforcement, or social tasks towards those living on the estate. However, the people living there did not tax any longer in return of the using of the land. The large estates worked on as economic units. The patron rights (priest and teacher appointments) lived on, in these issues the estate agreed with the bishopric of Vác.<br><br>
      The fact that the state became the owner and the castle was used by the royal couple created a peculiar situation at Gödöllő. The supply of the castle and its surroundings, as well as the hunts gradually became one of the Vienna major-domo's office tasks. Forestry was separate and conducted an autonomous management. Agriculture meant the cultivation of various lands (fields, meadows, pastures) and animal husbandry. Parts of the management duties were the handling of leaseholds, carrying out maintenance and supervision work. All of these were ordered to the Ministry of Finance. Later, the Ministry of Agriculture took over the task. At the beginning the main sectors of the economy were crop production and sheep husbandry, by the turn of the century they have been replaced by cattle husbandry. This was coupled with a modern dairy production. In crop production fodder plants had the leading role.<br><br>
      The crown estate gradually became a model farm, it became responsible for the development of agriculture. This was due to the policy of Ignác Darányi Minister of Agriculture, who encouraged development. The estate became the training farm  for veterinary students. In 1906 a distillery and a potato pilot plantation began operations in the Farm of Szentgyörgy, where at the beginning was a dairy school too. In the frames of the program of the Ministry the Royal School of Poultry was built, and then they began beekeeper training at the bee farm, and on the belonging plantations the development of water resources  management was started. As a part of forest management, the park named after Archduke Joseph (today Arboretum) began operations in 1902, as a pine pilot plantation.<br><br>
      The crown estate remained in state hands after the First World War, just as the other similar estates, the management went on under ministerial authority.<br><br>
