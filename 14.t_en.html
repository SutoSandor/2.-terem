  <h1>Social life from the mid-19th century until World War II</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
      The composition of the population of Gödöllő changed by the end of the 19th century. In the middle of the century farmers, local artisans, some merchants and the estate officers were the local society. By the turn of the century the population doubled (nearly five thousand people) and the ratio of the civilian classes changed: in addition to officials, lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, and secondary school teachers  the number of tradesmen and craftsmen increased and became more significant. The town's turning into  a holiday place, nevertheless just on a seasonal basis, but increased the number of citizens. In addition to the local peasants, many of them had their land or vineyards too.<br><br>
      Social life changed with the seasons. In spring and summer, the people from Pest made local life more colorful. After 1867 the royal family, between the two world wars Governor Miklós Horthy's stay raised public interest.<br><br>
      The various associations were key elements of the local social life. At the turn of the century two associations worked in the town: the aristocratic Kaszinó (Casino) from 1871 and the Civil Kör (Civilian Circle) from 1901. The Kaszinó's first seat was in the Erzsébet Hotel (now the museum building). It had a rich library. Every year they held a summer and a carnival dance, and there were banquets and concerts too. The Civilian Circle was a non-political association that ignored religious and social differences. It had a  smaller library than the Kaszinó, but here too journals, cards and other games were available for the members. During Carnival they had festivities several times.<br><br>
      The Volunteer Fire Brigade was re-established in 1890 in Gödöllő (the first club died in a short time). After the success of the Millennium firefighter contest they won the support of the local population. The volunteer firefighters in addition to their duties held more charity balls and festivities every year. The proceeds were used to improve their equipment.<br><br>
      The Gödöllő és Vidéke Általános Ipartestület (Gödöllő and its Surroundings General Industrial Cooperative) is linked to the large number of local industrialists, and after the dissolution of the guilds it brought together the area's craftsmen based on the industrial law (1893). The events of public life were made more colorful by the performances of the industrialist singing circle. They had a famous concert at the unveiling of Queen Elizabeth's statue in 1901.<br><br>
      The holidaymakers also organized gatherings. Such was the Goulash evening of the Máriabesnyői Nyaralóegyesület (Máriabesnyő Holidaymakers' Association) in August 1913. To meet the recreational needs of the holidaymakers, the first spa opened in Gödöllő in 1885.<br><br>
      By the end of the 19th century, as indicated by the holiday homes also, recreational activities appeared as well. Our town also developed sports facilities. Bathing was enriched by swimming competitions, the Torna Club (Sports Club) of Besnyő and the Gödöllő youth had a football match, the tennis court in Erzsébet Park announced competitions. The Budapest-Hatvan automobile competitions organized in the early 1900s also went through Gödöllő.<br><br>
      Between the two world wars the old guilds ceased to exist or changed their political views. Of course, the forms of entertainment remained, there was a great need for charity events. The member institutions of charities (Magyar Asszonyok Nemzeti Szövetsége (National Association of Hungarian Women), Stefánia (Stefánia)) formed in Gödöllő as well.<br><br>
      The most significant association then was the Gödöllői Járási Közművelődési Egyesület (Gödöllő District Cultural Association) replacing the Polgári Kör (Civilian Circle). Its most important event was the district exhibition organized in 1926, which presented agricultural, forestry, industrial, medical, cultural and artistic exhibitions.<br><br>
