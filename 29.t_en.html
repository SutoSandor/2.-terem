  <h1>Plots, courtyards and houses in Gödöllő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
  The smallest component of the inner part of the town is the plot, which in Gödöllő in every case has a regular shape. The regular-shaped plots form regular arrays, which goes hand in hand with the regularity of the streets as well. The vast majority of the plots in Hungary are belt-shaped, which is usually divided into courtyard, farm-yard and vegetable and fruit garden. The plots in Gödöllő were similar, but on the settlement's oldest area, that was the most suitable for farming, there was another type of division. Here the courtyard in front of the building was followed by a vegetable and fruit garden, and at the end of the plot there was the farm yard, the most important venue of agricultural work.<br><br>
Most of the courtyards in Gödöllő were yards with a linear- or an L-shaped house. In the mid 19th century, the vast majority of the houses were linear, where the buildings were lined up one after the other on the long side of the yard in a row, with falling roof height. In each case, the house was at the front, which was followed by the barn, the remise and animal pens. By the 1880s as a result of the transformations the number of the courtyards with L-shaped houses increased. In case of this kind of courtyards the L -shaped house was always facing the street and standing in a line with it.  The most prestigious rooms, the "clean rooms" were placed in this wing of the building. Sometimes some space remained between the houses that were standing close to each other where the door could fit, but it also happened that they could enter to the courtyard only through a so called "dry gate".<br><br>
The Gödöllő apartment buildings in terms of building materials have repeatedly undergone significant changes over the centuries. However, these changes were not always positive, it happened that from technological point of view it was a decline. Until the mid-18th century, the walls of the houses were made of twigs, plastered with mud. This type of construction technology is called the cob wall (in Hungarian sövényfal, lit. "hedge wall"). At that time  the balk of the roof was supported by a girder on an Y-shaped branch beam. This roof support system was usually used for weaker walls,  such as mud walls. For covering the houses in Gödöllő then and later as well, they used straw. From the mid-18th century, thanks to the support of count Antal Grassalkovich, they no longer used the mud wall technology for the newly built houses, but the more advanced and more expensive Moorish brick. The Moorish brick, also known as raw clay bricks, similarly to adobe bricks, were sun-dried bricks made of clay and soil. In the absence of support by the 19th century the mud wall became the dominant basic material of houses. Most of the houses were built without a foundation. The stone foundation appeared in the early 20th century, especially by the wealthier classes. Their roof structure was generally a pitched roof with collar beam, which at the early 20th century was covered with thatch, then later, from the 1910s and 20s onwards with tiles. <br><br>
The layout of the house was the classic room-kitchen-room. After the residential rooms came the larder -  in many cases with a loft ladder - and then the barn. The rooms were mostly earthen until the World War I, then the rooms were planked and the kitchen floors in the 1930-40 were covered with cement. In the rooms the ceiling in the 1920s was covered with wood, but it also happened that the former ceiling beams were left untouched.<br><br>
The street facade of the house was often painted in color, usually yellow, sometimes red, in many cases the pedestals had different color, painted gray or claret. But if the house's facade  was painted, it did not mean that the courtyard facade got a color too, in many cases it was whitewashed. The gable was made of wood, or brick and plaster. In many places in the tip of the gable they placed a pierced, carved wooden embellishment, with a top ornament, sometimes equipped with a skewer, which was placed in front of the ridge. The doors and windows were usually colored green, sometimes brown.<br><br>
At almost every house there was a  1.5-meter wide corridor on the full length of the yard facade. This was either built together with the house or it was the result of a subsequent enlargement. The corridor's floor was earthen, which was raised to the level of the house, this was covered in the 20th century with bricks, and later, from the middle of the century, with cement sheet. The gutter running over the corridor was often an integral part of the roof, so it  did not require any special support, the roof's timbers held it. Some of the corridors were built in at the front or at the end and turned it into a kitchen or a larder during the 20th century.<br><br>
The loft and the cellar had their entrance mostly in the larder. At many houses the fodder was stored in the attic of the house. Therefore, for ease of accessibility, at the rear of the house they made a hayloft door that was standing out from the attic space. In some cases, because of the increase of the number of family members, the larder and the barn were also turned into homes. <br><br>
Until the early 20th century the houses in Gödöllő had open hearths, then they started to build closed "kamin" chimneys, also known as "climbable chimneys" in the kitchens, in which case the room became totally free of smoke. The cylinder chimneys started to become widespread in the middle of the 20th century.<br><br>
