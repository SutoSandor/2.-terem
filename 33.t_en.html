  <h1>The Gödöllő artists' colony and World War I</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
 In 1901 Aladár (Körösfői)-Kriesch, the founder of the colony, moved to Gödöllő, this year can be regarded as the beginning of the colony, and the closing year of its operation is the master's death in 1920. Besides all this, the outbreak of the First World War greatly influenced the operation of the then-flourishing colony: it fundamentally changed the lives and art of the people living here. <br><br>
The young people who came here with the grant of the Hungarian Royal School of Applied Arts, were conscripted for military service. They took part in the great war, Ervin Raáb was a military officer, István Zichy was also called in, he gave up art after the war. He destroyed his previous works. The French nationality members of the artists' colony, Leo Belmonte and his family and Charles de Fontaney ,as Hungary and their country became belligerent, understandably tried to leave the country. Tom von Dréger was an official portrait painter in Austria.<br><br>
From the news of the School of Applied Arts we know that the two young grant awarded students of Gödöllő, Dezső Szendrő and Ferenc Ortner together with eight other students were killed in the war.<br><br>
Jenő Remsey and his brother Zoltán were also conscripted. Jenő was a pioneer at the Russian front, Zoltán was taken to the Italian front. In 1916, they already served as war painters. As the family recalled, they worked together with László Mednyánszky, János Vaszary and István Zádor. <br><br>
Ferenc Sidló, who got an apartment in Budapest at the Százados street artists' colony before the war, was a war sculptor.  He made the Statue of the National Sacrifice in front of the Palace Anker, at Deak Square, Budapest, that was inaugurated on 12 September , 1915. He was also ordered to make the bust of Miklós Horthy, which could not be done, because the Governor was busy. He made the full-lenght sculpture of Archduke Joseph Colonel General in 1918 for the Margaret Island military exhibition, that was organized with the engineering leadership of István Medgyaszay. We can meet the name of the designer of the Gödöllő studio houses as the architect of the previous military exhibitions as well. The construction of the military exhibition in Lemberg was ordered on 28 April 1916, where the commander was István Medgyaszay, Hungarian royal army engineer lieutenant. The buildings representing the glory of the army were made of planks, beams, tarred paper and half birch trunks. At the exhibition visitors were shown the devastation of the war, the life on the front and the reconstruction.<br><br>
Sándor Nagy and Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch were still living in Gödöllő, since because of their age in 1914 they were not conscripted.<br><br>
Later they extended the compulsory military service, which concerned Sándor Nagy as well. In these times Sándor Nagy was thinking about becoming a war painter. He also thought that he would make the glass paintings of the Ludovica chapel in return for military service. Sándor Nagy in his writings clearly condemned war and considered it pointless.<br><br>
In 1918, as we know it from the Gödöllő press Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch went to war. According to an agreement between him, the Hungarian Minister of Culture and the Secretary of War he arrived at the front as a guests and worked as a war painter. He reported about his stay there in his Battlefield diary. <br><br>
The end of the War is officially the date of the peace treaty of 11 November, 1918, but we know well that the war was still not over, neither politically nor in people's everyday life.<br><br>
Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch wanted the members of the Gödöllő artists' colony to get back and work together again, but the enormous poverty, the war memories and political changes did not give a chance to it.  <br><br>
