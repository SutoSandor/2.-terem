  <p id="szoveg">
      Courtship had its own rules in Gödöllő. The people of Gödöllő, besides their own town, could go to Szada to court, and the people of Szada could also come here. There were no conflicts with neighboring Kerepes either, but lads did not went there much. However, with Máriabesnyő the relationship was not so good. There were often conflicts with the settlement belonging to Gödöllő, fights were frequent between the lads. "... I went to a Besnyő ball, but the girl was taken from me the very moment, I immediately got a punch from behind. We were 5-6 from Gödöllő. We fought with arms, chairs, tables, and glasses, everything flew that could fly.  I was very good in hitting the bowler hats in the nose of the lads. (The bowler hat was really fashionable) Finally we, Gödöllő guys, just had to flee." Remembered back to his young age Géza Szauer, 70-year-old retired barber in 1967.<br><br>
      At the beginning of the 20th century a wedding took place as follows.  The invitation of the guests to the wedding banquet happened personally. The guests gathered in the morning at the groom's house, and together with the groom they went to the bride's house, to replace the bride. They were walking to the house singing all the way. The groom went into the house with the groomsman and placed a bundle of money on the table. The bride picked up the money and then went out to the wedding party with the groom. After greeting the procession set off backwards. A Gypsy band was already waiting for them at the gate. Entering the house the bride greeted the groom's parents. This was followed by lunch, where at the start the best man said a toast and the groom greeted the bride. During lunch, the members of the wedding party greeted the bride one after another. After the main meal the groom poured wine for the bride, who drank and then the wedding cake was served. After lunch they danced the midday dance, and only then they began to dress the bride for the afternoon wedding. The bride wore a white silk wrinkly skirt, with a white wrinkly apron, and high boots occasionally with buttons. On her head she wore a wreath of wheat ear, which was decorated with white myrtle. The wreath and the best man's posy was in many cases, kept in a specific place in the living room in a specially crafted glass cabinet. The groom's dress was of blue cloth, and he wore a small waistcoat, white shirt, a hat and boots. A small bouquet was pinned on the hat. The Gypsy band went in front of the wedding procession, followed by the best man, then the bride and the groom,  then the rest of the wedding party. In the procession there were guests who brought wine and cake with themselves and were handing it out on the streets on the way to the wedding. In front of the church with a modest ceremony they had the civil wedding. But it happened also, that the civil wedding was held in the morning before the start of the wedding ceremony. After the church ceremony the wedding party returned to the house and dinner followed, which was not served in the house, but under tents set up in the garden. After dinner they were dancing until midnight. At midnight, there was the bride's dance, which the bride started with a candle is her hands, surrounded by the bridesmaids. At dawn, they distributed the remaining meat and pálinka (brandy), and at around  five o' clock the wedding party went home, except for the bridesmaids, the groomsmen and the bride's parents.
