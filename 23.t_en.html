     Primary schools and public schools<br><br>
The first written data about schools in Gödöllő is from 1708. However, the beginnings of education date back to an earlier period. As the town's population in the 17th century was Reformed, the data concern the denomination's  school that was offering primary education. A new school (1744) was built next to the new church, that was built in place of the one demolished during the construction of the castle. The Protestant children learned in this building until 1928, when the new, still existing building was inaugurated. Today, the Reformed Lyceum works there. The minister, Aladár Szabó jr.,  who was the head of the congregation from 1917, contributed a lot to the development.<br><br>
The Catholic population was settled down in Gödöllő by Antal Grassalkovich I.  in the middle of the 18th century. For them, the landlord founded a school as well, in 1769. It worked as a parochial school maintained by the estate,  near the castle chapel, in the area of the upper park. They got a new building in 1879. Now the St. Imre Catholic Primary School operates in this historic building. In Máriabesnyő the  Capuchins taught the children, the school was built in 1894 according to the plans of the parson, János Odrobenyák.<br><br>
The Jewish population of Gödöllő emerged in the 1850s. Their children were taught in a private school from 1871, the institution did not have permission. From 1875, however, the Jewish Elementary School taught the students. Györgyné Makary 's School for Girls worked in the second half of the century, without permission.<br><br>
The appearance of public schools brought a change in education. The County Public Primary School was established in 1904 in Gödöllő, in the building of the Petőfi Square Kindergarten. The children of poorer families went here. In the 1920's more National Public Primary Schools, so called Klebesberg Schools were opened in Gödöllő: at the state economic colonies, for the children of the officers and  workers working there, in Máriabesnyő near the church (there was a set-up theater as well), in the Alvég and in the Királytelep. The latter was a healthcare model school equipped with a spa. In the school at Alvég today there is the Hajós Alfréd Elementary School, at the Királytelep the Montágh Imre Primary School and Special Vocational School.<br><br>
In 1907on the initiative of  Emilia Garó the six-grade Public Girls' School was founded, which operated in the teacher's own house on Kossuth Lajos Street. The town soon took over the operation, and  first moved it to the old town hall, then on the main square (the present museum building). The Town Public Boys' School was opened only in the spring of 1945, and worked only for three years.<br><br>

High Schools<br><br>
The first high school in the town was the Gödöllő Minorite Gymnasium, which opened its doors in 1911; the initiative being realized after more than a decade of planning. Previously students could only have high school studies in Budapest or Vác. It operated for a year in a private house, then, between 1912-1916 in the old town house (in the building that now stands between today's Petofi Square and Gábor Áron street ), and later in the Erzsébet királyné hotel (Queen Elizabeth Hotel - now the museum building) rented by the town. The 1919 Hungarian Soviet Republic, that was supported by the high school's teaching staff, caused a break in the life of the school. After the impeachment of the Minorite teachers the nature of the school was changed, it became a Roman Catholic Grammar School and then a Roman Catholic Gymnasium of Natural Sciences. The Minorites abandoned Gödöllő.<br><br>
The school eventually worked until 1930. Its students were locals and children coming from the surrounding towns, mainly the children of middle and lower-middle class families. The Premonstratensian Gymnasium gradually took over the students.<br><br>
The Gödöllő Premonstratensian Gymnasium opened in 1924. As a result of the Treaty of Trianon the Premonstratensians of Jászóvár lost their gymnasiums in Košice, Rožňava and Oradea. The gymnasium in Gödöllő was established as a substitution, on an area carved out from the crown estate. The following year the St. Norbert educational institution was opened, and later the monastery. The gymnasium's  assembly hall became the chapel, which received a new altar in 1933, on the occasion of the IV.th Jamboree. The school building was decorated by famous artists (Sándor Nagy, Ferenc Sidló, Andor Dudics, Zsigmond Kisfaludy Strobl, etc). In 1931 the equestrian statue of Prince Kálmán, supporter of the Premonstratenesians of Jászó, was erected in front of the monastery, created by József Róna.<br><br>
The school had sports and skating rinks, a swimming pool, a tennis court, a library and a cinema room. It was an elite institution, where at the same time - in addition to the children of the aristocracy, the upper and upper -middle class - talented village children could learn too.<br><br>
The gymnasium's French department launched in 1938. During the World War, because of the shortage of teachers, here they were replaced by French prisoners of war. After the Second World War the French department was turned into a primary school. The State School of Fácános  (Gödöllői Állami Fácánosi Iskola) closed in 1950, under director János Epres.<br><br>
After the socialization (1948) the Premonstratensian gymnasium operated until 1950 as Ady Endre State Gymnasium. After the elimination of the gymnasium the school building was taken over by the University of Agricultural Sciences.<br><br>

Other educational institutions<br><br>
According to law, there was a repetitive school (after 1868) in Gödöllő as well, where  children could learn up to the age of 15 after elementary school. This was maintained by the town, after the turn of the century it worked within the frameworks of the Town Public Primary School, it taught economical studies to the students. The municipal tree nursery was the practice area. From the'30s the boys learned in the  elementary school at Petőfi Square, the girls the one in Alvég.  After the Second World War, this form of training ceased to exist.<br><br>
The First General Industrial Apprentice School opened its doors in 1892, it worked in the building at  7 Petőfi Square. The Poultry Husbandry Woman Worker Training School as an agricultural educational institution and model farm was established in the territory of the crown estate in 1897. In addition to training, research and breeding experiments were also conducted in the institute. In the late 1940s, the institution shifted towards the direction of large-scale poultry production.<br><br>
At the artist colony in Gödöllő, the Weaving school started to work in 1907.<br><br>
The Protestant Orphanage for Girls was created in 1922 based on social foundations, it was opened by the Budapest Philadelphia Deaconess Mother Church in a building purchased in the Kossuth Lajos Street. In the school the girls lived from pre-school age to graduation. Later poor children and children of other religions were also accepted in the institution. The orphanage ceased to exist in 1959, the house became a Protestant retirement home.<br><br>
The Forest Recreation School (Sun School) was created on the initiative of László Endre chief constable of Gödöllő, as a part of the health pilot program, to fight against tuberculosis. The Hungarian Royal Treasury gave an area to the Hungarian Red Cross Association in the Erzsébet park, where eventually Ede Toroczkai Wigand's plan, the Sun School was built. From 1932 it worked as a municipal healthcare public elementary school with a qualified nurse as a teacher. The school was named after Miklósné Horthy. Ten years later the building was turned into a healing school, and was expanded. In summer it was used as a  holiday resort too. (Today the Táncsics Mihály Road Kindergarten operates in its place.)<br><br>
The St. Stephen Boys' Home was built in 1935, within the framework of a national campaign. Its purpose was to enable some of the children of poor families to take part in professional (industrial, home industrial, agricultural) and patriotic education,  and start a suitable career. The products of the home's workshop were given to the daughters of Hungarian mothers as trousseau. In the spirit of self-reliance the students rented and farmed land as well. In 1942, with state support they bought the Kalántai Printing Press in Gödöllő. The institution was finally disbanded in 1950.<br><br>
The first School of Music was established in Gödöllő in 1937, but its progress stalled early.<br><br>
