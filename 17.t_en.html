  <h1>Holidaymakers</h1>
  <br><br>

  <p id="szoveg">
    As a result of the building of the railway, and later the suburban railway holidaymakers could appear in the town in increasing numbers. Already in 1895 more than 2,000 people spent the summer in Gödöllő. The royal court and its numerous guests also played a role in the rise of the number of holidaymakers. There were many who, by the influence of the court, permanently settled down in the town. Then serving the holidaymakers was already an important source of income. To this end, some of the houses were altered. Flower gardens were placed in front of the villa-like buildings, facing the street. In contrast, the rear part of the house and the farm yard remained the same.<br><br>
  Thanks to the holidaymakers holiday home colonies emerged at different parts of the town. Of these, the earliest was the area called Alvég, that was transformed. Here the construction of houses and villas started after 1867, when the railway transport began. On the west side of the Isaszegi road, close to the brook, farmers dealing with garden cultivation started to build their houses, on the east side of the road on the area between the road and the railway the citizens of Pest began to build their holiday homes. The constructions began after the building up of the railway, but a significant part of the villas were built in the early 20th century.<br><br>
  Another major villa colony in the town was the popular excursion destination of the first third of the 20th century and nationally famous pilgrimage site, Máriabesnyő. Almost all  of the villas were built in the former vineyards and orchards. The new settlement part started to grow from the monastery on the eastern side of Besnyő Óhegy and the end of the Hétház street along the highway and today's Damjanich street, completed with post office, school, shops and restaurants. On the Besnyő side of the Antalhegy, along the Erdélyi road a number of villas were built next to the smaller houses. On the area opposite the Óhegy villas appeared in the late 19th century. At the former land consolidation the common pasture in the Fenyvesi dűlő was assigned to the cotters. On this area, that was first planted only with vine, the first holiday buildings slowly appeared. Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, in addition to the few vineyards, this became one of the characteristic villa colonies of Gödöllő.<br><br>
  The tram in Vác made the Öreghegy, that was far away from the town, easily available, so that part also began to develop rapidly. This area was one of Gödöllő's oldest vineyards, where the phylloxera epidemic of the 1870-80s almost completely destroyed the grapes. After the epidemic the vineyards were replaced by fruit trees because they were more profitable and required less care. From the beginning of the 20th century a greater number of houses and villas appeared among the press houses.<br><br>
  The holiday village features were supported by the large park areas in the center. From the direction of Pest , the Erzsébet Park came first, then the park area of the Főtér, with the castle park on its right side. After that came the Alsópark,  which almost entirely divided the residential area into two. The way to the train station and the Alvég led through it. On the east side of the town came the former Fácánkert,  almost as a continuation of the Alspópark, where starting from 1923 they built the Premonstratensian gymnasium, today's university. <br><br>
  The decline in the number of holidaymakers occurred after World War I, in 1923 600 families, in 1924 500 families, in 1925 300 families and in 1926 only 250 families had a holiday in Gödöllő.
