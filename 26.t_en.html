  <h1>The traditional costume of Gödöllő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
      By the first third of the 20th century lifestyle change also reached the costumes, then began the undressing among young people. The older women still wore the many skirted clothing even in the middle of the century, but the girls no longer followed the custom. The closest to the Gödöllő traditional costumes from the surrounding settlements was the folk costumes of Szada.<br><br>
       The local women's costumes were as follows. The hairdo for women was the bun, for girls a braid with colored ribbons woven in them at the ends. The women wore head scarf. Additional accessories included several lines of beads worn around the neck. The shawl was a part of women's wear, at the beginning they wore rosy cashmere and white lace shawl, which were later replaced by a woolen Berliner. In summer they used silk scarves, in winter the wealthy wrapped around themselves the very expensive camel-hair shawl too. During the holidays, the latter two were worn rather, the Berliner was essential for everyday wear, which they called "kájomér" scarf. Under the scarf they wore a white short-sleeved blouse, which was previously called "rékli". In summer, the blouse was replaced by a sleeve with a scalloped, so called "slingelt" edge. In colder weather a sleeveless leather waistcoat was also part of the wear, which they wore instead of jackets. In Gödöllő women's wear included an ankle-length pleated long skirt in different colors, under which they pulled on 5-7 starched white petticoats. In any case, a blue or black apron made of hard satin was put over the skirt. Under the petticoats they wore black stockings and pulled on black shoes.<br><br>

        The men's wear in the town was as follows. They wore hats or Kuchma as headgear. On the upper body they wore white collared-neck shirt with cuffs, over it a cloth waistcoat, which they called "lajbi", its buttons were generally made of bone. In colder weather they wore a cloth bekecs (jacket) as a small jacket, and as upper coat they wore also bekecs (jacket), or fur or sheepskin coat. The winter coat was mainly made of cloth, which was mostly black or possibly blue, its collar made of painted sheepskin. As trousers they wore breeches - that were mainly with straps, rather than flies - and as an essential accessory a belt. The pants were mostly made of black cloth, young people very rarely wore lighter colors. In front of the pants they tied a blue-dyed apron. They wore boots as footwear, which were at first side-sewn, later back-sewn boots became widespread, the heels were equipped with hoofs. In addition to the boots laced shoes also became fashionable after a while.<br><br>
        An average person usually had two sets of holiday and weekday clothes, and also had one pair of  holiday boots and two pairs intended for everyday use.<br><br>
        Initially the garments required for the costumes were made of self- woven fabrics. Later they bought clothing at fairs - where they could buy cheaper products - or from tailor masters. In Gödöllő between the two wars Jámbor Lajos Hungarian tailor satisfied the needs of the farmers. In addition to the clothes they also bought the boots at fairs. At bigger fairs even 20-25 shoemaker could sell their products. <br><br>
