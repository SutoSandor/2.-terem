  <h1>Soldiers from Gödöllő in the "Great War"</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
      After the mobilization following the outbreak of the war, more than 500 people marched in from Gödöllő. Most of them were immediately directed to the front. The soldiers from Gödöllő were in a variety of front lines during the war. They fought in the Galician offensive, the Serbian front lines, but there were  people who served on the French battlefield. Since May 1915 more and more people were fighting on the Italian front lines. Most of the Gödöllő soldiers were drafted in the No. 32 Infantry Regiment, which had its roots in the 18th century, and was considered as the home regiment of Budapest. The soldiers returned from the war with a wide variety of honors, awarded for brave behavior during the war and acts carried out during the fighting. Most of them got the Károly (Charles) Team Cross, that was founded on December 13, 1916. One of the honors that was given to many, was the Signum Laudis also known as the Military Merit Medal, that was founded by Franz Joseph I on 12th March 1890.  In 1917 Charles altered it and added his portrait to it. <br><br>
      Already in the second month of the war a significant number of the Gödöllő soldiers were among the wounded. Most of them became unable to fight during the major military movements in Galicia. The most wounded came from this area still in 1915,  then an increasing number of victims arrived from the Italian front. The wounded were often transported to Budapest or to Gödöllő to have hospital care. Although, as the name of the castle hospital of Gödöllő  -  "holiday-hospital" - also showed it, soldiers were rather recovering here before their next service or home care. Soldiers were hospitalized not only because of the injuries caused by weapons, but in many cases because of a variety of diseases they caught on the battlefield. There were who suffered from pleurisy  or pneumonia, or needed hospital care because of an infectious disease. The news of the first dead of Gödöllő came in September 1914. The Gödöllő és Vidéke (Gödöllő and its Surroundings) weekly informed its readers of the sad news in the shortest possible way. Among the register of the wounded, the following was written: "... here are the names of the wounded and dead (so far only one) who marched to war from Gödöllő. ... István Som † (38th Regiment) fell... ". A  few days after the death of István Som, János Németh master shoemaker and clerk of the Gödöllő charity table, who was wounded in the northern battlefield and treated in Austria, died of his wounds. During the war more than 200 soldiers fell from those who marched in from Gödöllő. The heroic dead were usually buried near the front lines, where they died. But even so, there are World War I soldiers buried in the cemetery of Gödöllő. The majority got wounded or fell ill on the battlefield and died at home, sometimes after several years of suffering. Apart from them, however, there are other fighters buried in the graveyard, who have less links to Gödöllő. Some of them died in the castle hospital, others were put down dead in Gödöllő train station from the ambulance trains that were transporting the wounded.<br><br>
      As a result of the changing military successes the first notifications about soldiers who had been taken prisoners came in five months after the outbreak of war. The first news came from the Russian and Serbian territories. Starting from the spring of 1915 an increasing number of notifications came of captured soldiers. At the fall of the fortress of Przemysl at the end of March 1915, many Gödöllő soldiers were taken prisoner. By this time most of the notifications came about the Russian captivity. In September 1915 news came about the first prisoner in Italy and then in October 1916 about the first Romanian captive. A significant number of the prisoners were taken captive seriously injured.<br><br>
      The conscription lasted for several years and from time to time caused serious problems in the life of the settlement. Once teachers, then workers of the public sector, the next time fire fighters were taken to become soldiers. Not only men were taken away for military service, but also horses. Nevertheless there was motorization in the army, horses still remained key factors.<br><br>
